# Evolutionary Algorithms Final Project

The project consists on selecting a solution using evolutionary algorithms to a simple problem using any algorithm from:
- Genetic Algorithms
- Particle Swarm, etc.

# Routing shortest path on road networks

The project consists on the classical shortest path on road systems which is commonly solved by using Dijkstra's algorithm.

Using Dijkstra's algorithm as baseline a genetic algorithm was modeled to solve the shortest path problem.
